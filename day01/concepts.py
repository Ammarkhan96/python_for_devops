#Variables and Constant

# 2 (constant) this only no the value of two is constant so two or any number in that case is a constant.

# If you provide this value of two in some kind of variable 
a = 2
a = 5
a = 10

#The value of "a" can be varying every time.

name = "Ammar"
name = "Khan"

isCool = True


#Types of data types

#interger(number)
a = 12    # <class 'int'>

#float
b = 3.5   # <class 'float'>

#string
c = "Ammar"   # <class 'str'>

#boolean
d = True   # <class 'bool'>
d = False  # <class 'bool'>


#I want to check the type of variable "a"

# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))
# print(type(d))



# Type Casting:   Whatever Value, whatever type you want any particular variable to be converted you just write this type. 

# print(float(a))   a = 12 converted into 12.0 which is float.
# print(int(b))     b = 3.5 convertes into 3 which is interger.



# Operators: Some kind of operations. 
# operators: + - * /

a = 100
b = 200

# assignment operators
# c = a + b
# print(c)

c = a * b
print(c)
# Whenever you assign a value from right hand side to left hand side we use a single equal to sign this is known as "Assignment Operators".


# Comparison Operators:
# < > <= >= == 

print(a > b) 
print(a = b)



# & | ! and or not

# "and" means this and this 
# "or" means either one of them
# "not" means whatever the value it is, false means true and true means false.
